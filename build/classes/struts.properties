### when set to true, Struts will act much more friendly for developers. This
### includes:
struts.i18n.reload = true
struts.configuration.xml.reload = true
#struts.i18n.encoding = utf-8
### - raising various debug or ignorable problems to errors
###   For example: normally a request to foo.action?someUnknownField=true should
###                be ignored (given that any value can come from the web and it
###                should not be trusted). However, during development, it may be
###                useful to know when these errors are happening and be told of
###                them right away.
struts.devMode = false
### when set to true, resource bundles will be reloaded on _every_ request.
### this is good during development, but should never be used in production
